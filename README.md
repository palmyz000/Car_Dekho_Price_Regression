## 🌟 Project Overview

This project presents a **machine learning web application** built with Streamlit, designed to **predict the selling price of used cars**. It leverages a robust **Random Forest Regressor** model, meticulously trained on a comprehensive dataset of car listings. The primary goal of this application is to offer a user-friendly and intuitive interface for estimating car prices based on essential features such as car name, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner history.

This initiative covers the entire end-to-end machine learning lifecycle: from initial data cleaning and comprehensive preprocessing to rigorous model training, thorough evaluation, and practical deployment, showcasing a complete solution for real-world application.

## ✨ Features

-   **Interactive UI:** 🤩 A user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface crafted with Streamlit for seamless input of car details.
-   **Real-time Predictions:** ⚡️ Get instant, accurate price predictions generated by the trained machine learning model.
-   **Comprehensive Preprocessing:** 🧹 Handles sophisticated data transformations including feature engineering (e.g., 'Car_Age', 'brand' extraction), robust ordinal encoding ('owner'), and efficient one-hot encoding for categorical features. All these steps are elegantly integrated into a `scikit-learn Pipeline` for consistent and error-free data transformation.
-   **Robust Model:** 💪 Utilizes a powerful Random Forest Regressor, renowned for its high predictive accuracy and exceptional ability to capture complex non-linear relationships within the data.

## 📊 Dataset

The foundation of our model's intelligence is the `car_dekho_data.csv` dataset, comprising various attributes of used cars.

**Key features utilized for prediction include:**
-   `Car_Name`
-   `Year`
-   `selling_price` (Target variable)
-   `km_driven`
-   `fuel`
-   `seller_type`
-   `transmission`
-   `owner`

### Data Preprocessing Highlights:
-   **Feature Engineering:** 'Car_Age' was meticulously calculated from 'Year', and the primary 'brand' was skillfully extracted from 'Car_Name'.
-   **Categorical Encoding:** 'owner' was efficiently handled with ordinal mapping, while 'brand', 'fuel', 'seller_type', and 'transmission' underwent precise One-Hot Encoding.
-   **Target Transformation:** The 'selling_price' was judiciously Log-transformed (`np.log1p`) to effectively manage data skewness and significantly enhance model performance.
-   **Feature Scaling:** Numerical features (`km_driven`, `owner`, `Car_Age`) were meticulously scaled using `StandardScaler` to standardize their range.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

The analytical core of this predictor is a highly optimized **Random Forest Regressor** model. This choice was driven by its proven track record of superior predictive accuracy and inherent capability to effectively handle complex non-linear patterns within the data. The entire data processing workflow, encompassing precise feature scaling and the robust Random Forest model, is intelligently encapsulated within a `scikit-learn Pipeline` for a truly streamlined and reliable deployment.

## 📈 Performance Metrics

The final model's performance was rigorously evaluated on a dedicated, unseen test set, with predictions inverse-transformed back to the original price scale:

-   **Final R2 Score on Test Set:** `0.7193` 🎯
-   **Final MAE on Test Set:** `122213.00 INR` 💰

These compelling metrics demonstrate that the model effectively explains approximately **71.93%** of the variance in car selling prices. On average, it predicts prices within an impressive `122,213 INR` of the actual selling price, showcasing strong generalization capabilities and effectively mitigating significant overfitting.

## 💡 How It Works

1.  **User Input:** ➡️ The Streamlit application intuitively collects car details from the user through an interactive, user-friendly form.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** ⚙️ The raw input data seamlessly undergoes the identical preprocessing steps applied during training. This comprehensive process includes meticulous feature engineering, precise categorical encoding, and accurate numerical scaling, all handled efficiently by the loaded `scikit-learn Pipeline`.
3.  **Prediction:** 🧠 The thoroughly preprocessed data is then fed into the highly trained Random Forest Regressor model, which confidently outputs a predicted selling price (initially in a Log scale).
4.  **Inverse Transformation:** 💲 The predicted log price is then accurately inverse-transformed back to the original Indian Rupee (INR) scale using `np.expm1()` before being presented to the user, ensuring clear and understandable results.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

To get this powerful application up and running on your local machine, simply follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/palmyz000/Car_Dekho_Price_Regression.git](https://github.com/palmyz000/Car_Dekho_Price_Regression.git)
    cd Car_Dekho_Price_Regression
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (highly recommended for dependency isolation):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    -   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Ensure model files are present:**
    The crucial `car_price_prediction_pipeline.joblib` and `feature_names.joblib` files (which were meticulously generated during model training and saved specifically for deployment) **must be located in the project's root directory** to ensure the application functions correctly.
